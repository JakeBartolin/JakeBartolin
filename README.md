Hi there! My name's Jake. I'm a tech-nerd with a history of making loud noises that people seem to like.

Looking for my music? [You'll want to check out my website here.](https://www.jakebartolin.com)

Although I've been tinkering with Linux, Python, and various forms of self-hosting platforms for years, I never made the full leap into the professional world of IT and development until early 2023. Some of my earliest projects include a private Nextcloud instance hosted on a Linode VPS, and a small XNA game I made in high school. Sadly, the source code for that game is lost to time as my source control was as good back then ðŸ˜….

I encourage you to take a look around, and feel free to DM me about any of the projects you see!
